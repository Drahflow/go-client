Contributing to the LaunchDarkly SDK for Go
================================================

We encourage pull-requests and other contributions from the community. We've also published an [SDK contributor's guide](http://docs.launchdarkly.com/docs/sdk-contributors-guide) that provides a detailed explanation of how our SDKs work.

Note that in order to run unit tests for the `redis`, `ldconsul`, and `lddynamodb` packages, you will need to have a local instance of the corresponding database running on its default port.
